# To test the code you can either change the numbers in the csv files or change the imput in the main function. All you have to do it compile and run the Firewall.java file. It runs all four files. They are almost correct. For some reason it is not returning true when both the file and input direction are inbound or outbound. I used the .equals function, but it's still returning false. I believe I have everything else correct, but I didn't have enough time to completely check or to find the bug.

#Iâ€™m the most interested in the Platform team followed by data team and then policy team.
