# To test the code you can just compile and run the Firewall.java file. It runs the examples provided in the assignment pdf. If you want to change the test you can either change the numbers in the csv files or change the imput in the main function. I believe I have everything else correct, but I didn't have enough time to completely check. I also just realized I might have done the program a little different from what is expected. For my program each Firewall object only takes in one rule, so if you want another rule you would have to create another Firewall object. If you want the object to have multiple rules, I could have put all the rules into a list or dictioary and iterate though it to check that it passes all the rules.
